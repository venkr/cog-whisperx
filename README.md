A Replicate implementation of WhisperX, forked from [daanelson/whisperx](https://replicate.com/daanelson/whisperx), with two changes: this uses the latest version of WhisperX, as of Oct 16 and it adds a flag to allow use of diarization via Pyannote 3.0

Use it on Replicate here: [whisperx-diarization](https://replicate.com/venkr/whisperx-diarization)
